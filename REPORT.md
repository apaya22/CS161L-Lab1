1st section: 
Created two other test benches for the gen_tick module we made. I added wire tick_100_5,and wire tick_100_50. These were already pre-defined but I went ahead and added those as my two additional testbenches. What they mean is basically each test bench should output a 50% duty cycle, which they all do.
